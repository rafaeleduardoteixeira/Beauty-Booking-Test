# Beauty Booking Test

It's test to arionkoder.com. I need to build a modern beauty salon booking application built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- 🎨 Beautiful UI with Tailwind CSS
- 📅 Service booking system
- 🗄️ **JSON Server** for mock database
- ⚡ Next.js 14 with App Router
- 🔷 TypeScript for type safety
- ✨ ESLint + Prettier for code quality
- 🔧 VS Code integration with format on save

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run Development Server

Start both Next.js and JSON Server:

```bash
npm run dev:all
```

Or run them separately:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Next.js (port 3000)
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - JSON Server (port 3001)
npm run server
```

### Initial commit

I created a simple project created by Windsurf AI, and I asked to create a project using the latest version of Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I then asked to make some changes to the project, and Windsurf AI helped me to make those changes, like DB.json, Eslint, Prettier, and some other files.
